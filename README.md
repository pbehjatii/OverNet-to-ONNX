# OverNet_to_ONNX
In this repository, we show how to export OverNet described in [["OverNet: Lightweight Multi-Scale Super-Resolution with Overscaling Network"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/papers/Behjati_OverNet_Lightweight_Multi-Scale_Super-Resolution_With_Overscaling_Network_WACV_2021_paper.pdf)] (for increasing spatial resolution within your network for tasks such as super-resolution) from PYTORCH to ONNX and running it using ONNX RUNTIME. 

### Requirements
- Python 3.5
- [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) (0.4.0), [torchvision](https://github.com/pytorch/vision)
- ONNX <https://github.com/onnx/onnx>
- ONNX Runtime <https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime>
